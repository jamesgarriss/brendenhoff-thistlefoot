Assassinate - You are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit (double all damage dice).

Lucky - When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

Brave - You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

Halfling Nimbleness - You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

Naturally Stealthy - You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.
